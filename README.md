# 🧪 LLM Eval Benchmark Lab

A modular, extensible evaluation framework for comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) across reasoning, safety, factuality, and performance constraints.

Designed for real-world GenAI teams who need systematic, repeatable evaluation pipelines — this lab simulates how models behave in production-like conditions under tight latency and cost tradeoffs.

## ⚙️ What This Project Does

✅ Compare open and closed LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, Mistral)  
✅ Run multiple eval modules: multi-step reasoning, safety refusal, factual QA  
✅ Log key metrics: latency, tokens, refusals, hallucinations  
✅ Configure each run with constraints (temp, context, task)  
✅ Output structured results + graphs for tradeoff analysis

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a PM working deeply in the LLM space (Deci.ai, Meta, Microsoft), I saw how chaotic real-world eval workflows are:
- Prompt testing with no scoring strategy
- Tradeoffs made with gut feel, not data
- No unified benchmark across models/tasks

This lab is my response. A productized evaluation harness that helps model teams **think clearly under constraint**.

## 🧪 Planned Eval Modules

- `reasoning_eval.py`: multi-hop logic under token limits  
- `safety_eval.py`: refusal to harmful / jailbreak prompts  
- `summarization_eval.py`: precision, verbosity, hallucination  
- `alignment_score.py`: GPT-based preference grading

---

## 📊 Future Ideas

- Streamlit dashboard for visual exploration  
- Prompt harness for reproducible testing  
- Red teaming module  
- Eval presets for Anthropic-style constitutional behaviors

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
python runner.py --config configs/gpt4_config.yaml

## 📢 LinkedIn пост (огнен, професионален, с визия):

```markdown
🔍 Most LLM product teams evaluate models like this:

• Prompt, tweak, eyeball.
• Maybe GPT grade it.
• Repeat until launch.

But when real-world latency, cost, and safety tradeoffs enter — it breaks.

That’s why I built the **LLM Eval Benchmark Lab**:
🧪 A modular evaluation framework for productizing model comparisons across:
✅ Reasoning
✅ Refusals
✅ Token efficiency
✅ Latency vs performance

You can configure models, constrain them, and analyze them like a PM, researcher, or infra engineer.

💡 Think: your own internal Anthropic eval harness — but open, testable, and extensible.
